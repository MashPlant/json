# Introduction

`json` is a simple json parsing & serializing library. It is still under construction.

The parser of `json` is generated by [lalr1](https://github.com/MashPlant/lalr1), which is also built by myself. Please refer to [parser.toml](./parser.toml) and [lib/parser.cpp](lib/parser.cpp) if you are interested about the mechanism of the parser generator.

# Caveats

This is a naive library, and I don't really expect it to be used in working environment. Currently here are some points to note:

- It store the a json `object` with a `vector` rather than a `map`, and duplicate key will be silently added.
- It won't perform string escape, the string is stored exactly as the input. 

# Performance

It is able to parse [apache_builds.json](https://github.com/chadaustin/sajson/blob/master/testdata/apache_builds.json) about 1400 times per second on my computer (AMD Ryzen 7 4800H), so we may briefly conclude that its parsing speed is more than 150 MB/s.
